I.    OVERVIEW

This mod adds a pack mule to the game. It will follow your party around and carry your equipment for you. To access the mule's inventory, talk to it and select appropriate option. The mule will try to avoid combat. However, it will defend itself if forced to. It cannot die. When badly injured, the mule will escape the area of combat and return when it's safe.
If you ever lose your pack mule (or you forget where you left it), you can use the "Call your pack mule" special ability. You can also use it to summon the mule into places where it wouldn't normally follow you (inside buildings, sewers and other such areas).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The game will not recognize items the mule carries as being in party possession.

You can buy the mule from a guy named Stedd, who can be found near the northeast exit of Waukeen's Promenade or in the courtyard of the Friendly Arm Inn (if you are playing Tutu or BGT, or BGEE). Haggle with Stedd to buy the mule at the best possible price. If you start a new game in ToB, the pack mule will be waiting for you in the starting area.

In the mule's spell menu, you can find three abilities you can use quickly to give orders to your pack mule. Those abilities are:
- Follow: this orders the mule to follow your party around 
- Stop following: the mule stops following your party but will move with you to the next area
- Stay: the pack mule will become a neutral character (making it unselectable); it won't follow you and won't move to the next area until you talk to it and change this order


II.   INSTALLATION AND UNINSTALLATION

Install this mod after any mods that add outdoor or dungeon areas to the game.

To install the Pack Mule mod, extract the archive content to your game's main directory and run "install-w_packmule.exe".
To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run "install-w_packmule.exe" again.


III.  KNOWN ISSUES

Sometimes the pack mule's shadow can face other directions than the mule.
